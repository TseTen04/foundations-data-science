# Final Assignment Options, Spring 2020

Typically the final project in this course involves working with a client and delivering a report on the communication and design strategies you employed, with a postmortem on what worked and didn't work and a research element for planning how to do things differently next time. Given the ongoing crisis, I am changing the final assignment to give more options about how it can be satisfied, to require less (and no in-person) coordination, and to generally lighten the load during a critical time.

For the final assignment in this course, please pick one of the following options:

## Option 1: Blog Post Series

For this option, you will create a series of three blog posts tracing your process as you learned a technical or design skill such as web scraping, creating user stories, or using Git. One possible way to organize these posts might be:

1. A first post on research and preparation. What is the technology or method? How were you introduced to it? What resources did you find or choose to use? What was or is your plan for learning?
2. A second post on either a specific challenge of learning the technology (such as having to break down the learning into smaller pieces, going back to the basics, or asking for new kinds of help) or describing some useful part of your process that others might learn from. Did you find experimentation on your own to be useful? Did speaking aloud about problems to others help? Did you collaborate with anyone in your learning?
3. A final post that either serves as a postmortem—how will you change how you go about learning similar skills in the future?—or that abstracts the process of learning to a larger domain, such as the academy, public life, the current crisis, or social justice. This is, perhaps, where you might speak to equity in technology, your hopes for learning skills that might be relevant to the ongoing Koronavirus situation, or how you might apply new skills in the workplace or as a student. You might also use this post to outline a plan for learning in the future.

 A good blog post is specific, and usually about 500-700 words. The different ideas in the numbered outline above are intended to be generative, and not to serve as boxes to tick—pick one or two suggestions or concepts and create something focused. 

Additionally, don't write for an audience of one, whether it be yourself or me. Think of an audience of real people and write for that audience. I will, later, encourage you to publish these on a real blog, though the actual publication isn't part of the assignment.

You can also look through this [smaller assignment](blog_post.md), part of the original course syllabus, and choose any ideas or concepts in there for your post series.

As an alternative to the structure above, you might also create a three-post series that is a tutorial for a technology or design method you've learned or which you're in a position to teach.

Your three posts should be written in markdown and posted to GitHub. If your writing will need to be private or confidential, reach out and we'll figure out an alternate arrangement.

## Option 2: MVP and Documentation

For this assignment, you will create an MVP, a minimum viable product, that will address a need. The need might be creating a website to share information, making a small game, gathering data from the web for your research, taking information from a user and doing something with it, or transforming some existing data into a more usable form. The need should not be purely analytical or research-oriented—that is, you should be designing something, even if that something is quite small.

For this assignment, it is **critical** that you scope your efforts up front. Apologies for the emphasis here, but in software design it is easy to fall into a trap of never being finished. It is perfectly all right, and in fact desirable, if your MVP only addresses some small, or even tiny, part of your need. You can always add to an MVP later. Focus on the word "minimum" here! We'll discuss scope more in class.

For this assignment, you will deliver a GitHub repository that has:

- A README.md that describes the project and tells someone how to set it up and run it, if relevant.
- The project implementation (i.e., Python files, HTML/CSS files, the Jekyll project, bash scripts, etc.)
- A short (500-1000 word) explanation of the project and the need it addresses in markdown format. You can call this "about.md" or similar.

## Option 3: Client Communication

This assignment is the closest to the original final project for this class, which can be found [here](project_deliverable.md). The purpose of the project is less to create some shiny technology than to engage with the process of communicating with another person to find their needs and how you might address them. The original assignment made this a process where you would speak with a client, create an MVP, and then iterate on it after receiving feedback. This assignment just asks for the first step in the process—speaking with a client, coming up with a plan for implementation, then revising it once based on client feedback. For this option, you don't need to implement any technical solutions—the focus is on communication with your client and then documenting and reflecting on this process.

To complete this option of the final assignment, you'll go through these steps:

1. Identify an individual with a need in the community who is in the market for a technical or design solution. If you can't identify someone, speak with me and I'll find someone, possibly a classmate, with a need. This individual will be your client.
2. Speak with your client. What is their need? What kind of technical or design solution are they asking for? (Do they know?)
3. Write up an initial implementation plan in the form of an email (or other relevant communication) to your client. This should be about 500-1000 words, but this length may vary.
4. Note feedback from your client on your plan. This may require another synchronous conversation (i.e., on the phone or Zoom).
5. Based on feedback from your client, revise your implementation plan. The final plan should be 750-1250 words.

For this assignment, you will deliver the initial plan (written as an email to your client), the final plan (which can be in the same format or something more for yourself), and a short reflection on the process (500-750 words) that discusses what worked and didn't work in your client communication, and what you might do differently next time. Unlike the other assignments, you can deliver this to me in any reasonable way you choose, such as in a .docx, PDF, Google doc, or GitHub repository.

## Option 4: Propose Something

Alternatively, you can reach out and propose your own final assignment for the course. Just send me an email with the course of work and deliverable you're suggesting.


## List of Technologies and Design Methods

The above assignments require thinking about what you have in your design toolbox—that is, what you will be learning about, writing about, and using. The below tecnical and design areas have been, or will be, touched on in class and might, individually, be worth thinking about with regard to the above assignments. I provide it here so that items might spark ideas in relation to the above three options.

- The UNIX command line
- Git for version control and collaboration
- The GitHub service for collaboration and the sharing of code and writing
- Python fundamentals (variables, conditionals, loops)
- Python modularity (importing libraries, creating functions)
- Manually creating a static website with HTML / CSS
- Researching and writing user stories
- Web accessibility fundamentals (i.e., semantics in HTML)
- Generating a static site with Jekyll
- Web scraping with requests (you may wish to look into the Beautiful Soup library as well)
- Code introspection and exploration in Python (print, type, dir, len, dict.keys(), list slicing)
- The Flask web framework
- SQL (we may need to drop this based on modifications to the class due to the remote format)

Concepts we touched on (or will touch on) that might be worth further exploration as part of the above assignments:

- History of the web
- Free and open source software*
- Plain text as a concept
- The UNIX philosophy (small tools, interoprerability, everything is text)
- Writing in markdown
- Constraints in software design
- Design methodologies ("waterfall," agile, Scrumm)
- Mentorship and building community

* The last class really enjoyed a week on the free and open source software movements, but this last year has been so rough for the movements (major controversies and accusations against various leaders, including the people we would normally read) that I've taken a step back to reevaluate. Please reach out for reading recommendations if this area interests you, and we may have a chance to rework it into the class before the end of the semester.
